# KRIZZY OPS - Cursor Rules

## Architecture
- FastAPI app in main.py
- Engines in engines/ directory (rei_dispo_engine, govcon_subtrap_engine, watchdog_engine)
- Utilities in utils/ directory (airtable_utils, discord_utils, twilio_utils, validate_env, kpi)
- Threading locks prevent double-runs
- Background daemon threads run continuously

## Code Style
- Keep functions simple and focused
- Use threading.Lock() for engine synchronization
- Post errors to Discord via post_error()
- Post ops updates via post_ops()
- Validate environment variables on startup

## Deployment
- Railway.app with Nixpacks builder
- Uvicorn ASGI server
- Health check at /health endpoint
- Manual triggers at /trigger/rei and /trigger/govcon
